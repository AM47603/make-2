# Shadow Fight 2-Recreated
Hey Guys! I have created the story and goals of the game in project. Try to click Play button without changing input "Name" multiple times, and then try to fill out the name and try. My idea is to create shadow fight game which is already published in play store. There is 1 pc and 1 npc in game. I will try to create for pc's and mobiles the player will play on. The sound I will add afterwards in designing the game. I am using p5.js so I can't use OOP which is for matter.js.
